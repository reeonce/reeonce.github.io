学习iOS开发进入另一个阶段，既然已经对 Objective-C 有了一定了解了，不妨来试试 swift.

还没翻几页《The Swift Programming Language》，**我去！这跟 JavaScript 好像**。

1. 变量使用 var 来声明

	```swift
	var firstString = "Hello world!";
	```

2. 函数与闭包可以直接作为参数, 都是**引用类型**

3. 类中的变量与函数的上下文是类

4. 闭包 [https://blog.avoscloud.com/1304/](https://blog.avoscloud.com/1304/)

5. optional type 

>Swift also introduces optional types, which handle the absence of a value. Optionals say either “there is a value, and it equals x” or “there isn’t a value at all”. Optionals are similar to using nil with pointers in Objective-C, but they work for any type, not just classes. Optionals are safer and more expressive than nil pointers in Objective-C and are at the heart of many of Swift’s most powerful features.

Optionals are an example of the fact that Swift is a type safe language. Swift helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of your code expects a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake. This enables you to catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.
