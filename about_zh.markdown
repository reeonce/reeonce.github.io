### 简单介绍

My name is **Reeonce Zeng**, living in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China

I have received my bachelor degree in software engineer in *Beihang University*.

I have been working with **Node.js** for more than one year. Although it is an efficient and magic programming language, but I'd like to following TJ's step and leaving for new area ☺.

Now I prefer to working with the exciting area - **iOS** development.
