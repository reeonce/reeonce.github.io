### Introduction

My name is **Reeonce Zeng**, {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1991 }} years old, living in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.

I have received my bachelor's degree on software engineering in *Beihang University*.

I have been working with **Node.js** for more than one year. Although it is an efficient and magic programming language, but it seems not energetic as I thought. Therefor, I'd like to leave the area, so as leaving Beijing for Shenzhen.

Now I prefer to working with the more exciting thing - **iOS** development.

Features are the app keeps your Internet passwords into keychain, and all the personal secrets will be encrypted with AES256, meanwhile, all data are managed with Core Data, Auto Layout also takes efforts much less when making the universal app (both on iPad and iPhone).

  [**Trap The Dot !**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trap-the-dot-!/id922876408?ls=1&mt=8). A game based on SpriteKit using Objective-C. The features are, the app is localized into 9 languages, you can share the game snapshot to your friends with Facebook, and the app has integrated with iAd and UMeng Analytics. Of course, the dot is not stupid, be careful to not let it escapes.
