### Introduction

My name is **Reeonce Zeng**, {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1991 }} years old, living in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.

I have received my bachelor's degree on software engineering in *Beihang University*.

I have been working with **Node.js** for more than one year. Although it is an efficient and magic programming language, but it seems not energetic as I thought. Therefor, I'd like to leave the area, so as leaving Beijing for Shenzhen.

Now I prefer to working with the more exciting thing - **iOS** development.
