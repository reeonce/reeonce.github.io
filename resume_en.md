### Major Skills
#### Fundamental
  With several years' coding experience and over tens of thousand lines of code, I am getting new understanding on programming.

  I can implement most of the fundamental data structures and algorithms.

  Also, I am always feeling curious on new techniques.

#### iOS development
  I love swift language and believe it will become better and better. Also I am familiar with Objective-C and the main frameworks of iOS. My projects:

  *Banlv*. This is the major product of xjimi, a LBS based app for scenic areas. The APP is built for iOS7 above and with Swift. I had contributed codes for almost every file, which related to mapbox, a star, alamofire, sqlite, cordova and so on.

  *Trap The Dot !*. A game using Objective-C. The app is localized into 9 languages, you can share the game snapshot to your friends with Facebook. Of course, the dot is not stupid, be careful to not let it escapes. Now, it has been refactored for iOS 9 with Swift 2. What's more, travis-ci has been integrated.

  *Others*. Some tool apps at xjimi.

#### Frontend programming
  I have used grunt, jQuery, less, sass, angularJS in my projects.

  *MYC*. A website based on Mojito(a open source Node.js framework) and YUI3.

  *reeonce.github.io*. My blog page.

  *Banlv voice tourist*. A mobile site to provide voice tourist inside some park.

#### Backend development
  Had been using Node.js for years, and I am familiar with working on linux, docker.

  *CKV*. This project aims to provide a key-value storage service for yahoo mobile apps. As the major developer, I must prepare for the environments, develop, integrate with CI and CD myself.

### Other hobbies
I have not done any sports for a very long time, as time is spent on reading, thinking and cooking.
