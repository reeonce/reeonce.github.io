### Major Skills
#### Fundamental
  With several years' coding experience and over tens of thousand lines of code, I am getting new understanding on programming.

  I can implement most of the fundamental data structures and algorithms.

  Also, I am always feeling curious on new techniques.

#### iOS development
  I love swift language and believe it will become better and better. Also I am familiar with Objective-C and the main frameworks of iOS. My projects on iOS are:

  *Banlv*. This is the major product of xjimi, which is based on LBS and for scenic areas. The APP is built for iOS7 above and with Swift. I had contributed codes for almost every file, which related to mapbox, a \*, alamofire, sqlite, cordova and so on.

  *Passwords Safes*. An app to manage your passwords which is developed with Swift. Features are the app keeps your Internet passwords into keychain, and all the personal secrets will be encrypted with AES256. Meanwhile, all data are managed with Core Data. Auto Layout also takes efforts much less when making the universal app (both on iPad and iPhone).

  *Trap The Dot !*. A game using Objective-C. The features are, the app is localized into 9 languages, you can share the game snapshot to your friends with Facebook, and the app has integrated with iAd and Analytics. Of course, the dot is not stupid, be careful to not let it escapes.

#### Frontend programming
  It is unbelievable that the web is growing so fast. npm, bower, grunt, bootstrap, foundation, jQuery, less, sass, angularJS, what I have learnt are not enough to title me a "professional web development engineer" (ok, just because I am not a designer?). My projects of web are:

  *MYC*. A website based on Mojito(a open source Node.js framework) and YUI3.

  *reeonce.github.io*. My blog page.

  *Banlv voice tourist*. A site on mobile to provide voice tourist inside some scenic areas. The link is a demo, as the real service is no longer maintained.

#### Backend development
  Had been using Node.js for years, and I am familiar with working on linux, docker.

  *CKV*. This project aims to provide a key-value storage service for yahoo mobile apps. As the major developer, I must deal with most of the things by myself, such as preparation for environment, development, CI and CD integration.

### Other hobbies
I have not done any sports for a very long time, as time is spent on reading, thinking and cooking.
